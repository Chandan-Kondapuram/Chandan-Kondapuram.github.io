## Projects
### Credit Card Approval Prediction
	             
- Preprocessed the Credit dataset using R by handling missing values, normalizing continuous variables, encoding Categorical Data, and detecting outliers. These steps ensured a clean and robust dataset for modeling.
-	Developed and fine-tuned Logistic Regression and Ridge Regression models, achieving test accuracies of 85% and 88%. Utilized backward stepwise selection based on the Bayesian Information Criterion to optimize predictor selection, enhancing model performance.
-	Leveraged Advanced statistical analysis and Data visualization in R to identify key predictors influencing credit approval decisions. This comprehensive analysis provided actionable insights, significantly improving the decision-making process and demonstrating the model’s real-world applicability in credit risk assessment.
